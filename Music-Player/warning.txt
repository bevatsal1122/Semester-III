You own your life's responsibility while watching and reading this code.
I am nowhere responsible for the after-effects and I would not own any part of the medicinal costs.
I sincerely request you to call ambulance first and keep it ready before reading and trying to understand this code.
Nor I nor almighty would be blamable for the complexity of the code since you are going through your own risk.

Hope this note saves your life ðŸ¥¤
